I am a PhD candidate from the Asian School of the Environment at Nanyang Technological University. I graduated from Wuhan University with a bachelor’s degree in Geophysics and from the Department of Earth and Space Science at the Southern University of Science and Technology with a master’s degree, advised by Kejie Chen.

I am now working on earthquake rupture process inversion. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at lumingzhelu@gmail.com.

My academic work has been published in Tectonophysics and Chinese Journal of Geophysics.This work aims to use multiple observations (e.g., GNSS, InSAR, Teleseismic waveforms, Strong ground motion) to estimate the rupture process of big earthquakes. It is critical to understand seismic hazard, earthquake physics and plate tectonics.
