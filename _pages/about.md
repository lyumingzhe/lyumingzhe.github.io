I am a master student from the Department of Earth and Space Science at the Southern University of Science and Technology. My major is geophysics, and I have maintained an overall GPA of 3.65/4.0. I am proud to have received the 2022 National Scholarship for Postgraduates and the 2022 CGU Student Excellent Paper Award. Throughout my graduate studies, I have demonstrated my research capabilities by publishing two SCI papers as the first author in esteemed journals like Tectonophysics and the Chinese Journal of Geophysics.
