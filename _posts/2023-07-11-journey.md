I'm very fortunate to have spent my master's years in the Department of Earth and Space Science at SUSTech. Here, I would like to share with you my growth and achievements over these three years.

## Arriving at SUSTech
I remember the summer of 2020 when I first arrived at SUSTech. I couldn't contain my excitement. After living in a ground-floor dormitory in Wuhan for four years and feeling almost stagnant, although the temperature in Shenzhen was still high, seeing the clear blue sky and clouds that seemed within reach made me feel refreshed and full of energy. With this initial joy and surprise, I began my three years of study and life in Shenzhen and at SUSTech.

## Learning and Research
The study of professional courses in my first year is a memorable period for me. I am a very active person, and compared to sitting in the office from morning till night, I prefer the feeling of attending classes. Moreover, such opportunities for attending classes become rarer in the future, so I cherished every course I attended. During this period, I also got to know other outstanding teachers in the Department of Earth and Space Science besides my advisor. One teacher who left a deep impression on me was Academician Chen Xiaofei, who derived advanced elasticity dynamics formulas for us every Friday afternoon. His profound understanding and vivid explanations of the fundamental formulas greatly benefited me.

Compared to the study of professional courses, my path in scientific research was a bit more complicated. On May 22, 2021, a Mw7.4 earthquake occurred in Maduo County, Qinghai Province. Fortunately, as the epicenter was located in a sparsely populated high-altitude area, no casualties occurred. I conducted some work related to this earthquake as my research subject and wrote my first paper. After submitting it, I received two major revisions, mainly due to a lack of innovation. However, not being rejected was already fortunate in my opinion. With the guidance of Professor Chen, I read literature, conducted experiments, and finally managed to get it accepted. Through this experience, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the entire process of writing papers, submitting them, and revising them. 

To further investigate the surface rupture characteristics of the Maduo earthquake, I went to Qinghai for fieldwork on July 22, 2022, under the guidance of Professor Chen Kejie. July is one of the most beautiful months in Qinghai. Although fieldwork is tough, it was still a journey where I could appreciate stunning scenery.

## Academic Conferences
If you were to ask me when I was the happiest during these three years, my answer would definitely be when I attended conferences. Professor Chen also often encouraged us to attend conferences and broaden our horizons. During my master's program, I participated in a total of four domestic academic conferences: the 2020 CGU Annual Meeting in Chongqing, the 2021 CCGG Annual Meeting in Qingdao, the 2022 CGU Online Meeting, and the 2023 CCGG Annual Meeting in Wuhan. These four conferences greatly enhanced my ability to give oral presentations and allowed me to meet many outstanding scholars in the field. Through exchanges with them, I broadened my horizons and deepened my understanding of academic research. Additionally, the various academic reports and seminars during the conferences provided me with fresh research ideas and inspiration. Of course, besides academic exchanges, the delicious food and beautiful scenery during the conferences also left me with many wonderful memories.

## Epilogue
Looking back on my time in the Department of Earth and Space Science at SUSTech, I deeply feel that I have experienced tremendous growth and gained a lot here. Under the guidance of Professor Chen, I received systematic training in scientific research, covering literature review, coding, paper writing, and presentation skills, which laid a solid foundation for my future academic pursuits. I have met many excellent teachers in the department, whose outstanding achievements and passion for research serve as examples for me to continually learn from. I have also made many like-minded friends, and discussing academic and life matters with them has made my future path less solitary. I am grateful for Professor Chen Kejie's dedicated guidance, the careful cultivation from the Department of Earth and Space Science, and the help and companionship of all my friends. I hope everyone cherishes their precious time at SUSTech, continues to grow, and keeps progressing.

Thanks for reading, and see you next time!
